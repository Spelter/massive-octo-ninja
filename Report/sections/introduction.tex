\section{Introduction}


This report documents the requirement specifications of “NTNUs Ultimate Digital Learning platform” (NUDL), which is a proposal for an IT-system for the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). NUDL proposes to digitalize some of the current processes involved in studies at NTNU, such as delivering a complaint on a grade, to ease the process for all parties involved and cut an unnecessary load of paperwork. Beyond that it also proposes to streamline these processes, along with the processes that are already digitalized, under a standardized user interface and an updated security system.

\noindent
The report will begin with an analysis of the current situation, highlighting the processes and problems we found most in need of rework and digitalizing. Following, there will be an in-depth explanation of how we propose to solve these issues, and how NUDL will work and respond when put to use in situations that are managed by other systems today.
