\section{Old system}
\subsection{Several systems}
Today's system is divided into several semi-independent systems. This is for instance StudentWeb, Eksamensweb, Innsida 2.0, It's Learning, and etc. This means that a student has to go through several systems to do something simple. If you would like to register into a new course, you would have to deal with three different systems (Figure \pageref{fig:Register-old}). If you would like to complain on the grade, you must also interact with 3 systems, some of which demands manual labour from the faculty staff (Figure \pageref{fig:Complain-old}).
\subsection{Complexity}Since the total system is divided into several sub-system, these systems are unnecessary complex and slow. Some of these systems are also:
\begin{itemize}
\item Proprietary closed source.
\item 15 year old code base.
\item Architecturally locked in to Microsoft technologies.
\item Licensing costs.
\end{itemize}This means that they are not easy to upgrade and not very modular. It also means that if we were to upgrade only parts of the current system, it will probably end up just as complex as the current system since we would have to consider the parts that is left.
